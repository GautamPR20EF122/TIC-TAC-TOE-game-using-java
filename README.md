# TIC-TAC-TOE-game-using-java
This is a simple TIC TAC TOE 2V game, I have made the design with help of xml.
Used built-in themes and at certain places I've customized the theme. The game has three different pages, firstly the start page which would require the users to type their name, the second page directs to the game. And the last page is a pop-up or a dialogue box that tells the winner or was the game tied. 
There are three java files, first one is the main file which has most of the codes in it. The secod file is for adding the players, or rather a seprate class to add the players. And the last and final java file is responsible for the dialogue box to appear or in other words, it takes care of the result of the game.
